## About the Project

This repository documents my **30-day hands-on SOC (Security Operations Center) Analyst Challenge**. Each day focuses on a practical blue team skill — from log analysis and threat detection to incident response and EDR-based monitoring — using real-world tools like Splunk, Wazuh, Wireshark, Suricata, and forensic platforms.

**Built as part of my cybersecurity self-learning journey and professional portfolio.**

## Key Learning Outcomes

* 🔎 Log analysis (Windows, Linux, IDS, HTTP, SSH, UFW)
* 📊 Splunk SPL searches for network & host-based indicators
* 🛡️ Incident response & containment (brute force, malware, phishing)
* 🧪 Threat detection using Wazuh EDR and Suricata IDS
* 🧰 Forensic techniques using VirusTotal, URLScan, CyberChef, etc.
